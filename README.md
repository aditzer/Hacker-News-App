# Hacker News App

An app using which user can search news about anything (any word) and look at all the different posts with thier author and ratings related to it. User can also see all the comments associated with a post.

The app was developed using Flutter framework.

I have used MVVM architecture using Bloc state management for this project.

Here is the link for demo video of working app: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JbOTPm36ex9g5u6O-4LaymmjwAk2kuyP?usp=sharing
